## Does heteroscedastic matter

1. simulate some data with no relationship between the predictor and the response, but with changing variance
 - hint use `x <- 1:100`
 - `y <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = seq(1, 10, length = 100))`
 
2. Fit a model. Is it significant?
3. Repeat this 1000 times. How many models are significant? How many would you expect?
 - hint use `replicate` extract p value from `anova`


# NLS

- Import data amount.csv
- Do a non-linear regression
- Interpret the results
- What is the expected value if calcium = 10?
