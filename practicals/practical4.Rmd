```

1. Import bird1.csv
2. Fit a model using lm
3. Pick a point and calculate the likelihood given the mean and residual 
4. For the same point estimate the log-likelihood
5. Estimate the log-likelihood for all points
6. Use different  regression coefficients and redo question 2 to 4
7. Use lm and glm to estimate the relationship of weight and temperature
8. Compare the results
9. Calculate the likelihood for the saturated model (mu~i~ = y~i~)
10. Use the log-likelihoods to estimate the Deviance
11. What is the relationship between the Deviance and the sum of squared residuals, assuming Normal distribution?
